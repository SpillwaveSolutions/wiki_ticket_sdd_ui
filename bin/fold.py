fold.py -- derive work item state from the append-only event log.

Reference implementation of WORKLOG-SPEC section 6.

State is a fold over events. Nothing here writes. The log is the truth; this
file is the only thing allowed to decide what it means.

Read section 6 before changing anything in here. In particular:
  - Order is by `ev`, never by file position and never by `ts`.
  - A corrupt line is skipped, never fatal.
  - `close` takes its status from `set`, it does not assume "done".
  - A later write to a field clears earlier recorded conflicts on that field
    (section 10.6); a conflict recorded after the write stays open.

Taxonomy migration (docs/plans/2026-07-18-work-taxonomy.md section 3.2): the
legacy single `type` field is a deprecated alias. On create/snapshot the fold
maps it into (`level`, `kind`) and drops `type` from the ITEM (the event line
is never touched). A create carrying neither type nor kind folds to
kind:triage -- unclassified must look unclassified (section 2.3); that
default is applied on `create` only, never on `snapshot` -- a snapshot must
be a lossless round-trip of the state it was given (WORKLOG-SPEC section 7
step 7), and defaulting there would fabricate taxonomy for items that were
never created in the first place (e.g. a closed orphan). This is LENIENT by
design: the fold never crashes on a bad pair; hard validation lives at write
time (CLI) and in the hook/CI check.

    new, never-before-seen item enters the fold. `snapshot` must stay a
    lossless round-trip of whatever state it was given (compact.py writes
